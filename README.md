# Rock_Paper_Scissor_Game

Hey all!!!
I have created the famous Rock-Paper-Scissors game in python 3.9
In this project, I have used two modules namely
random and sys.

I have used random module to select a random choice for the computer and play against the user.

I have used sys module to close the game if User selects any inappropriate choice from the given options.

I have also used if-elif ladder to check and match the choices of player and computer.

After each round, the system asks user for a rematch and if the user denies that, Computer bids the user a good-bye
